# Java Class Fundamentals
## Overview
This repository started when I taught object oriented programming for Third year undergraduate students in Engineering in 2021.

It consists of Java programs demonstrating fundamental and more advanced concepts covered in class.

There are over a dozen programs, each demonstrating a specific concept or technique in Java. The programs are desinged as stand alone projects focused on various aspects of Java programming, including object-oriented principles, inheritance, polymorphism, GUI, and more.

They are largely drawn from or inspired by the classic textbook "Java: How to Program" by Deitel & Deitel, with some additional examples and exercises.

## Java Programming Examples
Basic programs include:
- [GradeBook](GradeBook/src/GradeBookTest.java) which demonstrates the use of classes and methods to manage student grades.
- [Account](AccountTesting/src/AccountTesting/AccountTest.java) which creates a simple bank account system with deposit and withdrawal functionality.
- [ArrayList](ArrayListEg/src/ArrayListTest.java) shows how to create dynamic arrays for processing results.
- [Complex Numbers](ComplexExperiment/src/ComplexTest.java) which illustrates the use of classes to represent and manipulate complex numbers.

More advanced programs include:
- [Animal Sounds](Animals/src/AnimalSounds.java) which demonstrates polymorphism and inheritance by creating a hierarchy of animal classes. It uses an example of animals making different sounds, but called from the same method.
- [Employee](Employee/src/EmployeeTest.java) which illustrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism in an employee management system consisting of employees on different modes of payment.
- [GUI](kamaulincoln/Java-Class-Fundamentals/ScreenSaver/src/ScreenSaverTest.java) which demonstrates how to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.


## How to run the programs
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g. VS code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Navigate to the `src` directory .
4. Open the Java file you want to run.
5. Run the file using your IDE's run configuration or from the command line using `java <filename>.java`.
